# xkpasswd

A remake of [the original xkpasswd.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20240130164133/https://xkpasswd.net/s/). Should be pretty much feature compatible; notably, your existing config JSON will work the same.

Check out the live version at [xkpasswd.maxcutlyp.com](https://xkpasswd.maxcutlyp.com/).

## Quick start

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python server.py
```
